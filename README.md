# INNOVIT
Overview-
By 2026, India faces a dual crisis: a 220% rise in loT-based cyber-attacks and a massive security gap in home automation. Traditional firewalls fail because they are passive and reactive. With 86% of Indian households now connected to the internet, millions of "unsecured" smart devices (cameras, bulbs, locks) have become entry points f or financial fraud and personal data stealing. These devices are the "open back doors" into Indian homes. By building an agentic zero trust system we are creating a "Digital Immune System", a network that itself fixes before a human realises there's a breach.

Setup Instructions-
 The current prototype requires Python to be downloaded as it is lacking a UI as of now. The code needs to be run on the Python interpreter.

Progress Description-
Currently the project is technically correct with there being a heavy load on the interpreter resulting in unideal loading times. The GAN is fully functional with 1,000 layers. The sniffing scanning system has been implemented by means of Scapy and Socket.
